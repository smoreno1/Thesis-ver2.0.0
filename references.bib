A: a) Antibodies: direct fluorescent-labeled antibodies are preferred. For example, the antibodies are diluted adequately in PBS containing both 0.5\% Triton™ X-100 and 0.01\% NaN3. b) Nuclei staining reagents: propidium iodide can be used. Propidium iodide is diluted to 10 µg/mL with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.5 M NaCl. Q: Can antibodies from my laboratory be used? A: Some proteins do not change their antigenicity during fixation or tissue-clearing procedures. However, this is not conformed for all the proteins. It is recommended to initially test the antibodies you are already using. Q: Can fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies be used? A: We do not have information about protocols using secondary antibodies. It takes significant amounts of time for the two-step treatment with both primary and secondary antibodies. Therefore, we recommend directly labeling your primary antibody with fluorescent reagents. Q: What kind of fluorescent proteins can be used? A: We assessed the retention of fluorescence intensity in GFP. Some fluorescent proteins, such as, EGFP, EYFP, mCherry, and mKate2, have been confirmed to retain their fluorescence signals (Cell 2014, 157, 726.) Q: What kind of fluorescent labeling dyes can be used for immunohistochemical staining during clearing step? A: It is confirmed in references (Cell 2014, 159, 911. or Cell Rep. 2018, 24, 2196.) that Such fluorescent labeling dyes as FITC, Rhodamine, Alexa594 and Alexa647 can be used. Page Top During Clearing Steps Q: What kind of container is suitable? A: Any container that is slightly larger than the organism specimen being cleared is suitable. For mouse organ clearing, a container that is slightly bigger than the organ itself is recommended because the organ may expand during the clearing procedure. CUBIC products are aqueous-based reagents, thus they can be used safely with any laboratory plasticware such as polypropylene or polyethylene. Q: Does tissue swell? If yes, will this influence the experiment in any way? A: The tissue or organs may expand during the clearing; However, it has been reported that relative cell position remains the same. Thus, expansion is linear and uniform. Q: Could the sample fixation step be omitted because the organs undergo the clearing steps as soon as they are excised? A: In the samples without fixation, the structure of cells may be destroyed, thus, they should be fixed before clearing steps. Q: Is it possible to clear the samples after they were excised and fixed? A: The samples which were soaked in fixing solution for several weeks or which are stored at -80°C for several months after fixation can still get cleared. Q: Can paraffin embedded samples be sectioned and get cleared by CUBIC? A: Paraffin embedded samples can get cleared by CUBIC after thermal deparaffinization. However, samples should not be sectioned to a few µm thick. After getting cleared, samples become fragile and a few µm thick of samples cannot be treated. Therefore, samples should be sectioned by razor or something to one mm thick or thicker and then treated under CUBIC. The reference (Sci. Rep. 2017, 7, 9269.) mentions the way to clear samples in detail. Q: What quantity of these reagents are required for tissue clearing? A: For mouse whole-body clearing, the volume of reagents used must be sufficient to submerge the entire specimen. For example, for the whole-body clearing of a mouse, 200 to 400 mL of CUBIC-L and 100 to 200 mL of CUBIC-R+ are needed. For mouse tissue clearing, the volume of reagents needed is half the volume of the organ being cleared. For example, 20 to 40 mL of CUBIC-L and 10 to 20 mL CUBIC-R+ are needed. Q: The clearing of organs or bodies was interrupted and did not occur successfully. A: There are a few possible reasons. Consider the following troubleshooting options. a) The pH of PFA solution for fixing organs or bodies is too high. When the pH is more than 8, organs and bodies become over-fixed and are less cleared, thus, the pH should be adjusted between 7 – 7.5. b) Delipidation is incomplete. Samples are immersed in CUBIC-L with gentle shaking at 37 °C for 2 – 5 days or more, and fresh CUBIC-L should be used daily. c) Clearing is incomplete. The clearing time period can be extended. Additionally, consider replacing and using a fresh CUBIC-R+ solution. Q: How long does it take to delipidate samples? A: Approximately 3 days are required to delipidate the lung, intestine, pancreas and spleen of an adult mouse, and approximately 5 days to delipidate the heart, brain, liver and kidney. Page Top After Clearing Samples Q: Mounting Solutions (Product Number: M3294 or M3292) are necessary for observation cleared samples? A: If the observation is temporary, samples can be observed in not mounting solutions but CUBIC-R+ or CUBIC-X2 with the samples and objective lens soaked. However, when it takes for a long time (more than one hour) to get images or something, the CUBIC reagents evaporate during the observation because they contain water. Evaporation may cause the refractive index change and make image acquisition difficult, and as evaporation proceeds, the CUBIC reagent may crystallize. Therefore, it is recommended to use mounting solutions which contain no water for long-term observation. Q: How should the reagents be disposed of following use? A: Please dispose of the reagents according to the regulations of your institution. Reagents used to soak animal or organ samples are typically treated as medical waste. The unused CUBIC-L, and R+ reagents are non-flammable waste liquids. Please refer to the included package insert for reagent descriptions and constituencies. Q: How should clearing samples be stored? A: Clearing samples can be stored at room temperature in CUBIC-R+ or CUBIC-X2. CUBIC-R+ and CUBIC-X2 contain many solutes and a little water as a solvent. Thus, the samples should be stored sealed by parafilm or other means to prevent reagents from evaporation. The agarose gel embedding sample can also be stored at room temperature. [How to embed in agarose gel] Add agarose powder to the used CUBIC-R+ to a final concentration of 2\%(w/v) in a tube, and dissolve it by heat. Embed samples into the mixture before gelation, and prepare the gel by cooling it. This agarose gel can be stored at room temperature, and if required, the head of the tube can be cut and the gel pushed out. The surface of the gel becomes dry and white when it is pushed out; therefore, it should be used immediately after pushing. Q: Clearing samples cannot be observed well. A: Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) or confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) is recommended for the observation of the samples. Clearing samples become gel-like and it may be difficult to cut them into thin slices. The samples should be observed in Mounting Solution (RI=1.520) or Mounting Solution (RI=1.467) with objective lens which are available of these RIs. Q: What is the refractive index (RI) of CUBIC reagents? A: The RI of CUBIC-R+ is 1.52 and that of CUBIC-X2 is 1.467. The objective lens or the immersion oils which are suitable for these RIs should be used. They should not be mixed with other solvents such as water in order to change their RIs. Q: CUBIC-1, CUBIC-2 have been described in some papers, are they the same as CUBIC-L, CUBIC-R+? A: CUBIC-1, CUBIC-2 differ from CUBIC-L, CUBIC-R+ in terms of their clearing ability, as CUBIC-L, CUBIC-R+ is superior. CUBIC-1 and CUBIC-L play the same role in delipidation and decoloring, and CUBIC-2 and CUBIC-R+ play the same role in RI matching. CUBIC-R also differs from CUBIC-R+. CUBIC-R is composed of nicotinamide and CUBIC-R+ is composed of N-methylnicotinamide. CUBIC-R+ is superior to CUBIC-R in terms of maintaining fluorescent signals. **The clearing or staining result differ according to the samples or staining reagents. Please examine the treatment time or the concentration of staining reagents.

	abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is a powerful model for studying neural development, but conventional imaging methods are either too slow or phototoxic to take full advantage of this system. To solve these problems, we developed an inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM) module for noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples. iSPIM is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and facilitating SPIM use by development and neurobiology laboratories. iSPIM offers a volumetric imaging rate 30× faster than currently used technologies, such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos, scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting ∼25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei. By merging two-color iSPIM with automated lineaging techniques we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons expressing the transcription factor CEH-10/Chx10 and (ii) visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging rate of iSPIM effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously inaccessible.},

Initial results obtained using fluorescent pollen grains are presented, together with a measurement of the resolution of the system and an analysis of the potential performance of future systems. Since only the plane of the specimen that is being imaged is illuminated, this technique is particularly suited to time-lapse 3-D imaging of sensitive biological systems where photobleaching and phototoxicity must be kept to a minimum, and it could also be applied to image microfluidic technology for lab-on-a-chip, cytometry and other applications.},

In particular, the renewable aliphatic polyesters of poly(hydroxyacid)-type homopolymers and copolymers consisting of polylactic acid (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) constitute the most promising bioresorbable materials for applications in biomedical and consumer applications. Among those polymers, PLA has attracted particular attention as a substitute for conventional petroleum-based plastics. PLA is synthesized by the fermentation of renewable agricultural sources, including corn, cellulose, and other polysaccharides. Although some of its characteristics are disadvantageous (e.g., poor melt properties, mechanical brittleness, low heat resistance, and slow crystallization), there exist potential routes to resolve these shortcomings. These include copolymerization, blending, plasticization modification, or the addition of reinforcing phases (e.g., chitosan (Cs), cellulose, and starch). In this review, we discuss the degradation mechanisms of PLA and its modified form in the environment, current issues that hinder the achievement of good Cs/PLA combination, and ways to overcome some of these problems. Furthermore, our discussion is extended to cover the subjects of hydrolytic degradation and weathering effects with different Cs/PLA blends.},

This method was introduced in 2013 but has been difficult for some researchers to implement., The development, refinement, and use of techniques that allow high-throughput imaging of whole brains with cellular resolution will help us understand the complex functions of the brain. Such techniques are crucial for the analysis of complete neuronal morphology—anatomical and functional—connectivity, and repeated molecular phenotyping. CLARITY is a recently introduced technique that produces structurally intact, yet optically transparent tissue, which may be labeled and imaged without sectioning. However, the utility of this technique depends on several procedural variables during the process in which the light-scattering lipids in a tissue are replaced by a transparent hydrogel matrix. Here, we systematically varied a number of factors (including temperature, hydrogel composition, and polymerization conditions) to provide an optimized, highly replicable CLARITY procedure for clearing mouse brains. We found that for these preparations optimal tissue clearing requires electrophoresis (and cannot be achieved with passive clearing alone) for 5 d with a combination of 37 and 55°C temperature. Although this protocol is optimized for brains, we also show that it can be used to clear and analyze a variety of organs. Brain or other tissue prepared using this protocol is suitable for high-throughput imaging with confocal or single-plane illumination microscopy.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a great source of human cardiac cells and can be combined with biomaterials to form engineered heart tissues (EHTs). Implantation of EHTs into the myocardium after a myocardial infarction (MI) is a promising strategy to regenerate the scar area. However, the ongoing challenge is the lack of electrical and mechanical coupling of the graft to the host tissue. Moreover, to replace the number of lost cells after an MI, current EHTs are large (cm-scale) and consist of {\textgreater}107 cells, resulting in extremely high costs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a cost-efficient platform based on the implantation of small EHTs ({\textless}50,000 hiPSC-CMs) grafted into the rabbit myocardium in vitro, and subsequently to assess the electrophysiological adaptations of the hiPSC-CMs to the surrounding myocardium using of fluorescent indicators. Methods: The EHTs (mm-scale) consisted of commercially available hiPSC-CMs (45.000 cells) seeded on top of a recombinant collagen-like peptide hydrogel (22 kPa; 6 mm diameter; 350 μm thick). Excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) properties of the EHTs were assessed in vitro. Adult male rabbits were euthanized and, subsequently, the heart was excised and placed on a Langendorff rig. EHTs were stained a fluorescent calcium indicator prior to implantation to track their activity. Calcium traces of the EHT and the ECG of the rabbit heart were compared during analysis. Results: Incorporation of fibronectin into the hydrogel improved cell adhesion and resulted in viable EHTs for at least 7 days. EHTs were not able to follow high pacing frequencies comparable to the intrinsic rate of the rabbit heart, most likely because of slower calcium handling. HiPSC-CMs seeded on the hydrogel showed an improved (“twitch”-like) contraction profile in comparison to cells seeded on rigid matrixes that showed a multi-phasic time-course. Once implanted, EHTs were viable for at least 90 min and calcium transients could be recorded for this time, however, there were no signs of electrical coupling during the experiment. Conclusion: With this work, a novel ex vivo platform has been developed to investigate functionality of implanted cells within the myocardium in the acute phase post-implantation. This platform can be used to investigate many factors that might affect the integration and survival of implanted cells during the acute phase in a cost-effective way and is therefore a good intermediate step between in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

	abstract = {Electrical integration of human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM)-based tissue with the host myocardium is a requirement of successful regeneration therapy. This study was designed to identify electrical coupling in the acute phase (1–2 h) post-grafting using an ex vivo model.Small, engineered heart tissues (mini-EHTs), consisting of ∼50 000 hiPSC-CMs on a hydrogel (spontaneous rate 0.34 ± 0.05 Hz), were loaded with Cal520-AM. EHTs were implanted sub-epicardially into a Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart after blebbistatin treatment. For up to 100 min, a continuous pseudo-electrocardiogram was recorded during sinus rhythm (rate 2.0–3.5 Hz). At 25 min intervals, EHT calcium transients (CaTs) were recorded for 10–20 s (no contraction group). To study the influence of mechanical activity, blebbistatin was washed off after implantation (contraction recovery group). Periodic entrainment of EHTs with the myocardium was detected less often (P = 0.011) in the no contraction group (1/9 hearts) than in the contraction recovery group (5/6 hearts). The average coupling delay (QRS-CaT) and the difference in consecutive delays (Δdelay) were 89 ± 50 and 10 ± 3 ms, respectively (n = 12 traces; N = 6 hearts). Coupling ratios (QRS:CaT) varied from 2:1 to 4:1. These coupling parameters were not significantly different in the two experimental groups. Modelling of hiPSC-CM tissue separated by a 25 μm saline gap from the myocardium demonstrated field-effect coupling with similarly variable activation delays. Importantly, coupling failed with a gap of 100 μm.EHT entrainment is possible immediately after grafting and has features compatible with field-effect coupling. Sensitivity to the gap dimensions may explain why entrainment is more common in actively contracting myocardium.},

	abstract = {Background:After myocardial infarction, the infarct border zone (BZ) is the dominant source of life-threatening arrhythmias, where fibrosis and abnormal repolarization create a substrate for reentry. We examined whether repolarization abnormalities are heterogeneous within the BZ in vivo and could be related to heterogeneous cardiomyocyte remodeling.Methods:Myocardial infarction was induced in domestic pigs by 120-minute ischemia followed by reperfusion. After 1 month, remodeling was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and electroanatomical mapping was performed to determine the spatial distribution of activation-recovery intervals. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and tissue samples collected from the BZ and remote regions. Optical recording allowed assessment of action potential duration (di-8-ANEPPS, stimulation at 1 Hz, 37 °C) of large cardiomyocyte populations while gene expression in cardiomyocytes was determined by single nuclear RNA sequencing.Results:In vivo, activation-recovery intervals in the BZ tended to be longer than in remote with increased spatial heterogeneity evidenced by a greater local SD (3.5±1.3 ms versus remote: 2.0±0.5 ms, P=0.036, npigs=5). Increased activation-recovery interval heterogeneity correlated with enhanced arrhythmia susceptibility. Cellular population studies (ncells=635–862 cells per region) demonstrated greater heterogeneity of action potential duration in the BZ (SD, 105.9±17.0 ms versus remote: 73.9±8.6 ms; P=0.001; npigs=6), which correlated with heterogeneity of activation-recovery interval in vivo. Cell-cell gene expression heterogeneity in the BZ was evidenced by increased Euclidean distances between nuclei of the BZ (12.1 [9.2–15.0] versus 10.6 [7.5–11.6] in remote; P{\textless}0.0001). Differentially expressed genes characterizing BZ cardiomyocyte remodeling included hypertrophy-related and ion channel–related genes with high cell-cell variability of expression. These gene expression changes were driven by stress-responsive TFs (transcription factors). In addition, heterogeneity of left ventricular wall thickness was greater in the BZ than in remote.Conclusions:Heterogeneous cardiomyocyte remodeling in the BZ is driven by uniquely altered gene expression, related to heterogeneity in the local microenvironment, and translates to heterogeneous repolarization and arrhythmia vulnerability in vivo.},

The mechanisms of heart regeneration among model organisms, including neonatal mice, appear remarkably similar. Orchestrated waves of inflammation, matrix deposition and remodeling, and cardiomyocyte proliferation are commonly seen in heart regeneration models. Understanding why adult mammals develop extensive scarring instead of regeneration is a crucial goal for regenerative biology.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) remains a prevailing cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally despite advancements in therapies and preventive measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 6.7 million individuals aged 20 or older in the United States are affected by HF. It is anticipated that the prevalence of HF will increase to 8.5 million Americans by 2030. Definition of Heart Failure HF is a multifaceted clinical syndrome arising from functional or structural impairment in the filling or ejection of blood by the ventricles, leading to a diverse range of symptoms. American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Stages of Heart Failure The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have outlined stages of heart failure to classify the progression and severity of the condition (Table 1. ACC/AHA Stages of Heart Failure).  Patients who have resolved symptoms and signs of HF with persistent left ventricular dysfunction are categorized as stage C and should receive appropriate treatment. If all HF symptoms, signs, and structural abnormalities completely resolve, the patient is deemed to be in remission from HF. Classification of Heart Failure by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Patients with HF are frequently classified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This classification system acknowledges the different prognoses and responses to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure. The 2022 AHA/ACC/Heart Failure Society of America (HSFA) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure identifies 4 classes of HF by LVEF (Table 2. Classification of Heart Failure by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction). New York Heart Association Classification of Heart Failure The NYHA classification of HF is a subjective evaluation by a clinician to delineate the functional capacity and symptoms of individuals diagnosed with ACC/AHA stage C or D heart failure. Serving as an independent predictor of mortality, the NYHA Classification is employed in clinical settings to assess the appropriateness of therapeutic interventions for patients in stage C or D of heart failure. The 4 NYHA heart failure classes are: Class I (Mild HF): No restrictions in physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not induce undue fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. Class II (Mild-to-Moderate HF): Slight limitations in physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary activities result in fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. . Class III (Moderate-to-Severe HF): Significant restrictions in physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activities lead to fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. . Class IV (Severe HF): Unable to engage in physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure are present at rest, and any physical activity exacerbates the discomfort.},

              Background
              Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) are regarded as promising cell type for cardiac cell replacement therapy, but it is not known whether the developmental stage influences their persistence and functional integration in the host tissue, which are crucial for a long-term therapeutic benefit. To investigate this, we first tested the cell adhesion capability of murine iPSC-CM in vitro at three different time points during the differentiation process and then examined cell persistence and quality of electrical integration in the infarcted myocardium in vivo.
            
            
              Methods
              To test cell adhesion capabilities in vitro, iPSC-CM were seeded on fibronectin-coated cell culture dishes and decellularized ventricular extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds. After fixed periods of time, stably attached cells were quantified. For in vivo experiments, murine iPSC-CM expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein was injected into infarcted hearts of adult mice. After 6–7 days, viable ventricular tissue slices were prepared to enable action potential (AP) recordings in transplanted iPSC-CM and surrounding host cardiomyocytes. Afterwards, slices were lysed, and genomic DNA was prepared, which was then used for quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate grafted iPSC-CM count.
            
            
              Results
              The in vitro results indicated differences in cell adhesion capabilities between day 14, day 16, and day 18 iPSC-CM with day 14 iPSC-CM showing the largest number of attached cells on ECM scaffolds. After intramyocardial injection, day 14 iPSC-CM showed a significant higher cell count compared to day 16 iPSC-CM. AP measurements revealed no significant difference in the quality of electrical integration and only minor differences in AP properties between d14 and d16 iPSC-CM.
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                The results of the present study demonstrate that the developmental stage at the time of transplantation is crucial for the persistence of transplanted iPSC-CM. iPSC-CM at day 14 of differentiation showed the highest persistence after transplantation in vivo, which may be explained by a higher capability to adhere to the extracellular matrix

Myocardial slices can be produced from a variety of animal models and human biopsies, thus providing a representative human in vitro platform for translational cardiovascular research. In this review, we compare myocardial slices to other in vitro models and highlight some of the unique advantages provided by this platform. Additionally, we discuss the work performed in our laboratory to optimize myocardial slice preparation methodology, which resulted in highly viable myocardial slices from both large and small mammalian hearts with only 2–3\% cardiomyocyte damage and preserved structure and function. Applications of myocardial slices span both basic and translational cardiovascular science. Our laboratory has utilized myocardial slices for the investigation of cardiac multicellularity, visualizing 3D collagen distribution and micro/macrovascular networks using tissue clearing protocols and investigating the effects of novel conductive biomaterials on cardiac physiology. Myocardial slices have been widely used for pharmacological testing. Finally, the current challenges and future directions for the technology are discussed.},

	abstract = {Traditional histology is the gold standard for tissue studies, but it is intrinsically reliant on two-dimensional (2D) images. Study of volumetric tissue samples such as whole hearts produces a stack of misaligned and distorted 2D images that need to be reconstructed to recover a congruent volume with the original sample's shape. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework called Transformation Diffusion (TD) for stack alignment refinement as a solution to the heat diffusion equation. This general framework does not require contour segmentation, is independent of the registration method used, and is trivially parallelizable. After the first stack sweep, we also replace registration operations by operations in the space of transformations, several orders of magnitude faster and less memory-consuming. Implementing TD with operations in the space of transformations produces our Transformation Diffusion Reconstruction (TDR) algorithm, applicable to general transformations that are closed under inversion and composition. In particular, we provide formulas for translation and affine transformations. We also propose an Approximated TDR (ATDR) algorithm that extends the same principles to tensor-product B-spline transformations. Using TDR and ATDR, we reconstruct a full mouse heart at pixel size 0.92µm×0.92µm, cut 10µm thick, spaced 20µm (84G). Our algorithms employ only local information from transformations between neighboring slices, but the TD framework allows theoretical analysis of the refinement as applying a global Gaussian low-pass filter to the unknown stack misalignments. We also show that reconstruction without an external reference produces large shape artifacts in a cardiac specimen while still optimizing slice-to-slice alignment. To overcome this problem, we use a pre-cutting blockface imaging process previously developed by our group that takes advantage of Brewster's angle and a polarizer to capture the outline of only the topmost layer of wax in the block containing embedded tissue for histological sectioning.},

	abstract = {Tissue section thickness (TST) is an understudied variable in digital pathology that significantly impacts both visual assessments and computational analyses. This study systematically examines the effects of TST on whole slide images (WSIs) and nuclear-level features using thyroid tissue samples (n = 144) prepared at thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 10 µm. By minimizing preanalytical variables and batch effects, we aimed to isolate TST as the primary factor in our experiment. Visual assessments indicated that thinner Sects. (0.5–3 µm) were more transparent with distinct cellular features, while thicker Sects. (5–10 µm) appeared darker with increased staining intensity and artifacts. Quantitative analyses were performed using open-source tools such as HistoQC for WSI quality control, HoverFast for nuclear segmentation, and feature extraction with Scikit-learn and Mahotas. Both WSI and nuclear-level metrics were significantly influenced by TST. The Haralick texture feature of difference entropy, which measures texture complexity, showed a 13.7\% decrease in nuclei as TST increased, indicating fewer complex textures in thicker sections. Additionally, intensity decreased substantially with thicker tissue, dropping by 26.1\% at the WSI level and 30.4\% at the nuclear level. WSI contrast exhibited an increase of 92.6\% when transitioning from 0.5 to 10 µm. These findings demonstrate that variations in TST can obscure or alter the appearance of biological signals, complicating both visual diagnostics and computationally extracted features. The study highlights the need for standardized tissue section thickness protocols, alongside consistent reporting of these standards, to ensure accuracy and reliability in both visual evaluations and computational analyses within digital pathology workflows.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The presence of dense adhesions within the pericardial space complicates reoperative cardiac surgery. Prior attempts to reduce adhesion formation after primary cardiac surgery using medications or biomaterials have had variable success. Carbylan-SX (Carbylan Biosurgery Inc., Palo Alto, CA) is a hyaluronan-based biomaterial, which has been shown to be effective at reducing adhesions in a nonthoracic rat model. This study evaluates whether Carbylan-SX can effectively reduce postoperative adhesions within the pericardial cavity.
Methods
Thirty-eight New Zealand white rabbits underwent a left lateral thoracotomy. A pericardiotomy was made and epicardial adhesions were induced on the anterior surface of the heart using a Dremel device (Racine, WI). The rabbits were divided into four groups: controls with abrasions only receiving no treatment (n = 10), Carbylan-SX films (n = 10), Carbylan-SX aerosolized hydrogel (n = 10), and Seprafilm (n = 8). The pericardial sac and chest were subsequently closed. Rabbits were sacrificed at a mean of 15 days. For histological analysis, each heart was divided into 12 separate 1 mm sections. Computer imaging software was used to measure the adhesion thickness and the mean of 12 random measurements for each animal was recorded and statistical analysis performed.
Results
Histological analysis revealed all treatment groups to be significantly better than the control (2159 μm thickness, P {\textless} 0.0001) at preventing adhesions. The Carbylan-SX film and Carbylan-SX aerosolized hydrogel both proved to be better at preventing adhesions than Seprafilm (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) with an average adhesion thickness of 454 and 577 μm, respectively, compared with 1319 μm for Seprafilm (P {\textless} 0.0001 and P {\textless} 0.0005, respectively). The Carbylan-SX film and Carbylan-SX aerosolized hydrogel were equally effective at preventing adhesion formation.
Conclusion
Carbylan-SX film and Carbylan-SX aerosolized crosslinkable hydrogel are equally effective methods of reducing postoperative pericardial adhesions within the pericardial cavity. Both the Carbylan-SX film and aerosolized hydrogel showed a significantly greater reduction in adhesions than Seprafilm. Clinical application of Carbylan-SX could have significant therapeutic implications in the future.},

	abstract = {Regenerating the human heart is a challenge that has engaged researchers and clinicians around the globe for nearly a century. From the repair of the first septal defect in 1953, followed by the first successful heart transplant in 1967, and later to the first infusion of bone marrow-derived cells to the human myocardium in 2002, significant progress has been made in heart repair. However, chronic heart failure remains a leading pathological burden worldwide. Why has regenerating the human heart been such a challenge, and how close are we to achieving clinically relevant regeneration? Exciting progress has been made to establish cell transplantation techniques in recent years, and new preclinical studies in large animal models have shed light on the promises and challenges that lie ahead. In this review, we will discuss the history of cell therapy approaches and provide an overview of clinical trials using cell transplantation for heart regeneration. Focusing on the delivery of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, current experimental strategies in the field will be discussed as well as their clinical translation potential. Although the human heart has not been regenerated yet, decades of experimental progress have guided us onto a promising path.
SUMMARY: Previous work in clinical cell therapy for heart repair using bone marrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiac-derived cells have overall demonstrated safety and modest efficacy. Recent advancements using human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have established them as a next generation cell type for moving forward, however certain challenges must be overcome for this technique to be successful in the clinics.},

	abstract = {Both genetic and non-genetic cardiac diseases can cause severe remodeling processes in the heart. Structural remodeling, such as collagen deposition (fibrosis) and cellular misalignment, can affect electrical conduction, introduce electromechanical dysfunctions and, eventually, lead to arrhythmia. Current predictive models of these functional alterations are based on non-integrated and low-resolution structural information. Placing this framework on a different order of magnitude is challenging due to the inefficacy of standard imaging methods in performing highresolution imaging in massive tissue. In this work, we describe a methodological framework that allows imaging of whole mouse hearts with micrometric resolution. The achievement of this goal has required a technological effort where advances in tissue transformation and imaging methods have been combined. First, we describe an optimized CLARITY protocol capable of transforming an intact heart into a nanoporous, hydrogel-hybridized, lipid-free form that allows high transparency and deep staining. Then, a fluorescence light-sheet microscope able to rapidly acquire images of a mesoscopic field of view (mm-scale) with the micron-scale resolution is described. Following the mesoSPIM project, the conceived microscope allows the reconstruction of the whole mouse heart with micrometric resolution in a single tomographic scan. We believe that this methodological framework will allow clarifying the involvement of the cytoarchitecture disarray in the electrical dysfunctions and pave the way for a comprehensive model that considers both the functional and structural data, thus enabling a unified investigation of the structural causes that lead to electrical and mechanical alterations after the tissue remodeling.},

	abstract = {Arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) is an important cause of mortality following myocardial infarction (MI). The rabbit has similar cardiac electrophysiology to humans and is therefore an important small animal model to study post-MI arrhythmias. The established approach of surgical coronary ligation results in thoracic adhesions that impede epicardial electrophysiological studies. Adhesions are absent following a percutaneously induced MI, which is also associated with reduced surgical morbidity and so represents a clear refinement of the approach. Percutaneous procedures have previously been described in large rabbits (3.5–5.5 kg). Here, we describe a novel method of percutaneous MI induction in smaller rabbits (2.5–3.5 kg) that are readily available commercially. New Zealand White rabbits (n = 51 males, 3.1 ± 0.3 kg) were anesthetized using isoflurane (1.5–3\%) and underwent either a percutaneous MI procedure involving microcatheter tip deployment (≤1.5 Fr, 5 mm), coronary ligation surgery, or a sham procedure. Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were used to confirm ST-segment elevation indicating coronary occlusion. Blood samples (1 and 24 h) were taken for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels. Ejection fraction (EF) was measured at 6–8 wk. Rabbits were then euthanized (Euthatal) and hearts were processed for magnetic resonance imaging and histology. Mortality rates were similar in both groups. Scar volume, cTnI, and EF were similar between both MI groups and significantly different from their respective sham controls. Thus, percutaneous coronary occlusion by microcatheter tip deployment is feasible in rabbits (2.5–3.5 kg) and produces an MI with similar characteristics to surgical ligation with lower procedural trauma and without epicardial adhesions., NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Surgical coronary ligation is the standard technique to induce myocardial infarction (MI) in rabbits but is associated with procedural trauma and the generation of thoracic adhesions. Percutaneous coronary occlusion avoids these shortcomings and is established in pigs but has only been applicable to large rabbits because of a mismatch between the equipment used and target vessel size. Here, we describe a new scalable approach to percutaneous MI induction that is safe and effective in 2.5–3.5-kg rabbits.},

The software also compensates for optical effects, thereby improving accuracy and enabling subsequent biological analysis.},

	abstract = {The optical clearing of the cardiac tissue has always been a challenging goal to obtain successful three-dimensional reconstructions of entire hearts. Typically, the developed protocols are targeted at the clearing of the brain; cardiac tissue requires proper arrangements to the original protocols, which are usually tough and time-consuming to figure out. Here, we present the application of three different clearing methodologies on mouse hearts: uDISCO, CLARITY, and SHIELD. For each approach, we describe the required optimizations that we have developed to improve the outcome; in particular, we focus on comparing the features of the tissue after the application of each methodology, especially in terms of tissue preservation, transparency, and staining. We found that the uDISCO protocol induces strong fiber delamination of the cardiac tissue, thus reducing the reliability of structural analyses. The CLARITY protocol confers a high level of transparency to the heart and allows deep penetration of the fluorescent dyes; however, it requires long times for the clearing and the tissue loses its robustness. The SHIELD methodology, indeed, is very promising for tissue maintenance since it preserves its consistency and provides ideal transparency, but further approaches are needed to obtain homogeneous staining of the whole heart. Since the CLARITY procedure, despite the disadvantages in terms of tissue preservation and timings, is actually the most suitable approach to image labeled samples in depth, we optimized and performed the methodology also on human cardiac tissue from control hearts and hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.},

            Systemic arterial hypertension is a highly prevalent chronic disease associated with hypertensive cardiomyopathy. One important feature of this condition is remodelling of intramural small coronary arteries and arterioles. Here, we investigated the implications of this remodelling in the downstream vascular organization, in particular at the capillary level. We used Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) exhibiting many features of the human hypertensive cardiomyopathy. We generated 3D high-resolution mesoscopic reconstructions of the entire network of SHR hearts combining gel-based fluorescent labelling of coronaries with a CLARITY-based tissue clearing protocol. We performed morphometric quantification of the capillary network over time to assess capillary diameter, linear density, and angular dispersion. In SHRs, we found significant remodelling of the capillary network density and dispersion. SHR capillary density is increased in both ventricles and at all ages, including before the onset of systemic hypertension. This result suggests that remodelling occurs independently from the onset of systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. On the contrary, capillary angular dispersion increases with time in SHR. Consistently, our multicolor imaging underlined a strong correlation between vascular dispersion and cellular disarray. Together our data show that 3D high-resolution reconstruction of the capillary network can unveil anatomic signatures in both physiological and pathological cardiac conditions, thus offering a reliable method for integrated quantitative analyses.},
